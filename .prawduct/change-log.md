# Change Log — TangleClaw

<!-- Append new entries at the top.

Tag-line conventions (ART-4K9M, ratified 2026-07-17):
- scope=  : ONE scope per unit of work. Work done under an ACTIVE build plan uses that
  plan's frontmatter scope (its ## Status roster derives checkbox flips from these tags).
  Post-plan work — backlog items, GH-issue fixes, chores landing after the plan is
  archived — gets its OWN scope (kebab-case of the backlog id or issue, e.g. ui-2p7t,
  wrap-583), NEVER a borrowed scope from an archived plan: an archived roster can't track
  new chunk ids, so borrowed tags rot (the ART-4K9M failure). A scope with no build-plan
  file is fine — regen-views flags it only while status=merged, and deliberately not once
  status=shipped (retired/planless scopes are expected history).
- chunks= and status= : **RETIRED upstream (prawduct 3.4.0, `lib/change_log.py`), along with
  the derived views that were their only reader.** Which chunks an entry shipped now belongs in
  the entry BODY, where readers actually look — the 2026-09-06 entries write `Train 13 Chunk NN.`
  as their first line. Historical entries carrying either key still parse (the parser preserves
  unknown keys), so nothing below needs rewriting; the two bullets that follow are kept as the
  record of why they existed and are no longer instructions. Noted 2026-09-06 because this header
  still read as live guidance and produced a `chunks=05` tag line on the Chunk 05 entry before a
  Critic pass caught it.
- status= : (none) on branch → `shipped` stamped at merge (AMENDED 2026-07-17, ratified
  under ART-7W2J/PRW-9K4C: upstream trunk semantics — TC restarts the server onto main
  right after merge, so merged work IS live; the wrap's version number is bookkeeping.
  The prior intermediate `merged` state created a merge→wrap window where prawduct
  3.0.5's fail-closed regen-views flagged every planless small-fix scope fatally).
  The WRP-9F2K release flip stays as a safety net (flips any `merged` stragglers at
  the next wrap promote); a STATUSLESS tag line remains the missed-stamp diagnostic.
  TC skips `release=` tokens — CHANGELOG.md is TC's release-notes surface, not
  prawduct's release-notes.md. regen-views derives build-plan Status checkboxes from
  status=shipped ONLY — the old convention left released work stuck at `merged`, which
  un-ticked genuinely shipped chunks (2026-07-17 back-stamp: 29 entries across
  v4.5.0–v4.19.0).

## 2026-10-07 — #2154: a Leave keeps a file out of the wrap commit whatever a later step concludes

<!-- prawduct: type=bugfix | scope=2154-keep-local-leave -->

#2154, single chunk, on the PM's dispatch (Medusa `bcb9fc02`, go `af9a58b7`). The defect behind Architect hold A27: closed PR #1927 carried a file the operator had answered Keep local for.

**Root cause.** `_file-ownership.js#classify` applied an Include / Leave answer only to a path it counted as foreign in that same call, and `session-files`, the changelog gate and `commit` each read ownership from the live tree. With no launch snapshot a path is foreign by change time, so a file answered Leave and then rewritten by something other than a wrap step read as the session's own at `commit` and was staged. The snapshot commit's body lists the file under "Session files", which is rendered from `owned`. Which of the two routes the incident took is not established: the log had rotated and no step records a run's answers.

**The change.** A path that would be `owned` and carries a Leave goes to `left`, and to a new bucket `leftSessionFiles`. The changelog gate excludes that bucket, and the secret check keeps scanning it so its report still names a flagged file the operator left. Architect ruling `44f1a715`: Leave always binds (Q1 a), TangleClaw maintenance is not held back (Q2), a wrap step's later write to a left path stays local (Q3), and answers must not outlive one wrap.

**A contract replaced, not weakened.** `test/wrap-file-ownership.test.js` asserted since #1406 that a Leave cannot drop the session's own file. It now asserts the inverse, under the ruling, with the reason beside it and in ADR 0002.

**Found while building.** The secret check had honored a Leave for the session's own flagged file since #1513, so two guards answered the same question differently. Taking the Leave in `classify` first dropped that file from the scan and from the report; one existing test caught it.

**Answers per wrap.** The page's first request of a wrap carries no path answers and resets what it holds; the server keeps a run's options only for a Retry of that run. Pinned by an executed test of `confirmWrap`.

## 2026-10-07 — #1937: advisory is the default recovery mode where the login is in force

<!-- prawduct: type=feature | scope=1937-default-flip -->

#1937 Chunk 04b, on the PM's dispatch (Medusa `74a6a092`), to the plan the Architect approved at revision 3. The Operator ruled on 2026-10-06 that advisory is the default; the Architect ruled on 2026-10-07 that it must not be the effective default where nothing can say who the operator is.

**The change.** A project with no operator decision on record resolves `advisory` while the login gate is `armed` and `operator` in every other state. `lib/recovery-default.js` owns that answer and carries the gate state with it; `server.js` installs its probe once the listener is bound, built from the listener and not from a request. `lib/project-config.js#resolveRecoveryMode` takes the answer as a boolean and stays free of a store or gate dependency. The launch reads the gate once, beside the operator's decision, and freezes the result.

**Departure from the parent plan, recorded.** Its section 3.3 flipped the seeded constant to `advisory`. The constant stays `operator`: every save writes it into `project.json`, and a file saying `advisory` is a request that is refused with a warning where the login is not in force.

**Tightened.** A file saying `advisory` with no decision on record no longer chooses advisory unless the gate is `armed` (Architect, approved). The file is in the project's checkout, where its session can write it.

**What a held launch is told.** One function, `operatorHeldHint`, writes the sentence the withheld step, the READY refusal, the unready nudge and `tc start status` print. Why comes from the project's live mode and source; what can be done comes from the gate state at the moment of asking. The Architect's blocking correction to revision 1 was that every non-`armed` state had been described as "no login" and pointed at a clear the route refuses in four of them. The PM's correction to revision 2 was that the open-install clear is reproducible by a local process, not refused; the sentence there names no operator and claims no proof.

**Found while building, and decided.** `load` hands a project with no file the seeded block, so "no file" and "saved long ago" both read as `inherited`, and the plan's notice ("this project moved from operator-cleared") would have been false for a project that never launched. The notice now says what the project's launches do from here on. It is served from the marker the claim wrote, which names the launch, so it needs no snapshot field.

**Tests.** Both install modes through the real launch path, every gate state from `GATE_STATES`; the gate and the decision each read once, held by a probe that changes its answer after its first call; each hint held against the real clear and readback routes in all six gate states, with the two open-install request shapes driven separately; the real probe on a real listener. Existing fixtures that reached advisory through the file alone now record the operator's decision, as the PATCH does; no assertion was weakened. A mutation pass over each mechanism added went red on every case.

**Carried in from earlier reviews.** The comment above the project-scoped 404 on the reconciliation route now describes the caller that reaches it; "pinned before advisory becomes the default" is gone from `test/advisory-ready-audit.test.js` and its `FEATURES.md` entry. The `project.recovery-mode-decided` event's `detail` is not touched: `lib/projects.js#updateProject` was not edited.

**Review.** Cumulative `rev-20261007T083228Z-a13e02bd`: 0 blocking, 5 warnings, 7 notes. Fixed in a docs-only commit: ADR 0017's "Alternatives considered" still called advisory-as-default refused and unsettled beside the R3 that settles it; and the docs promised the one-time notice without its two limits (a file whose `launchSequence` block has no `recoveryMode` key takes the default with no notice, and the notice is claimed when the launch is recorded, not when it is read). Filed as #2150: the launch does not record which gate state decided its frozen mode, the notice read's failure path has no test, a stale JSDoc, a duplicated predicate. Accepted: the probe install line in `server.js` has run only in tests of the probe it installs; its failure direction is operator-cleared, and the live check is owed after merge.

**After the PR opened (#2151).** The Architect approved both build-time decisions (PM Medusa `3ef4e590`) and required one copy fix: the notice ended "This notice is shown once", which is not true of a first launch that ends before its task step is served. It now says the notice belongs to the project's first launch under the default and is not repeated. A test pins the wording and that case.

## 2026-10-06 — #1937: the operator can read a launch's reconciliation

<!-- prawduct: type=feature | scope=1937-reconciliation-readback -->

#1937 Chunk 04a, on the PM's dispatch after the Operator approved the A24 exception. Architect ruling A83 made this a condition of the advisory default: the reconciliation a session writes was stored and returned to nobody.

**The change.** `POST /api/sessions/:project/launch/reconciliation` returns the stored text with its launch (sequence, attested revision, accepted-at, READY digest, preflight verdict, clearance) and the constant `provenance: agent-authored-unverified`. It runs `_requireOperatorWrite`, unchanged, which is why it is a POST, and serves only an `operator-verified` result. The Launch readiness panel gets a button on each attested row; the text is fetched on the click, escaped, labelled as the session's unchecked account, and long text sits in a `<details>`. `GET /api/launch-sequences` is not touched.

**Decision recorded in the plan.** A dedicated route over an operator-only field on the GET: that route's caller resolver reads any browser-shaped request on an open install as the operator, which a bound session can imitate with one header.

**Refused where there is no login (Architect, amending A83; PM Medusa `fc2a98ef`).** The first version served the operator proof's open-install result, and the cumulative review showed that a local process imitating a same-origin browser, with a page token it fetched itself, could read the text. The Architect ruled that a request's shape cannot satisfy "operator only". The route now serves only a proof result of `operator-verified`, so on an install with no login every caller gets `403 LOGIN_GATE_REQUIRED`, the dashboard included, and the panel shows a line in place of the button. Tests cover the dashboard's own request, an imitating process with and without a session's headers, and the exact request the recovery clear accepts. The documents do not describe this as a limit shared with the recovery clear: the Architect named that route's posture a separate question.

**Carried to chunk 04b by the same ruling.** Advisory is not to become the effective default on an install with no login; operator recovery stays the default there until a real operator identity check exists. Tests for the effective default on both install modes belong to that chunk.

**Also changed.** `test/api-coordinator-rotation.test.js` names the new route in the coordinator epoch-gate exemptions, with its reason: the roster guard, built from the registered routes, failed the first full run until it did.

**Review.** Cumulative: 0 blocking, 4 warnings. Fixed two leak channels that had no test (the server log, the Master on the launch list). Its warning that the documents said "sessions cannot read it" with no qualifier for an install with no login is what led to the refusal above. Two verify-resolutions rounds since, 0 blocking each. The duplicated operator-route preamble is filed as #2148. Owed after merge, on a live dashboard: press the button on an install with a login, and confirm an install with no login shows the line and no button.

**Split.** The default flip, the hint variants, ADR 0017's R3 rewrite and the contract-change tests are chunk 04b, in its own session, after this is on main.

## 2026-10-06 — #1937: the advisory READY path is audited and pinned by tests

<!-- prawduct: type=chore | scope=1937-advisory-ready-audit -->

#1937 Chunk 03, on the PM's dispatch. The Architect made this a condition of flipping the default recovery mode to advisory: a read-only audit of the advisory READY path, then regression tests for five named properties. Findings go to the PM before the default flip starts.

**The change.** Test-only. New `test/advisory-ready-audit.test.js` reaches recovery through the real preflight (a corrupt `current.json`, a crashed newest session, a handoff directory that cannot be read) and holds: a reconciliation is a string of real length after trimming, and stands in for neither the task step nor the verdict; the stored preflight, the files under the handoff path and earlier sessions' statuses are the same after the clear as before it; the clear is `agent-reconciled` with no operator, whatever fields the artifact carries, and READY never stamps it over a person's clear; a refused attestation, or a clear that cannot be written, leaves no attestation, clearance or event; and a launch keeps its frozen mode when the operator's decision changes under it, in both directions. No production code changed and the default is still `operator`.

**Evidence.** Twelve single-line source mutations in `lib/launch-sequence.js` and `lib/store.js`, one for each guard the tests rely on, each turned at least one of these tests red and were reverted.

**What the audit found.** No defect in the gate. Two things outside it, reported to the PM and not changed here: the reconciliation text is stored in the launch's READY artifact and no route, panel or command returns it to an operator; and `tc start status` still says an attestation "will need a reconciliation" on a launch that has already attested.

## 2026-08-20 — #990: forensic review of the ungoverned Antigravity window fixes 8 confirmed bugs

<!-- prawduct: type=bugfix | scope=antigravity-window-990 | chunks=01,02,03,04,05,06,07 -->

A 5-dimension multi-agent adversarially-verified review of commit range `v5.8.0..v5.10.0` — a
window where a different AI engine (Antigravity) committed directly to `main` with no Prawduct
governance active — surfaced 17 raw findings collapsing to ~10 distinct root issues. One
(`startWrapSse` ReferenceError) was already fixed post-v5.10.0 by #1005. This work fixes the rest,
confirmed still live on `main`:

- Shared-doc `fs.watch` handles never re-targeted on a `filePath` edit and leaked on delete — the
  most severe finding, independently corroborated by 4 of 5 review dimensions.
- `codex.json` advertised `capabilities.supportsSilentPrime: true`, but `syncEngineHooks()` clears
  hooks for any non-`claude` engine instead of writing them — not dead code, a live UI lie: an
  operator could enable "Silent Prime" for a Codex project and nothing would happen. Turned off;
  real support filed as backlog ENG-8V3N.
- Multi-file upload had no `FileReader.onerror` — a failed read hung the modal forever.
- CHANGELOG's `## [5.9.0]` "Master Session Recovery" `### Fixed` entry was fabricated (no such fix
  exists anywhere in history) — corrected via an `[Unreleased]` note, without touching the locked
  released section.
- Removed the dead live-wrap-progress SSE subsystem (zero consumers since #1005 removed its only
  client) and deduped shared-doc notify logic between two drifting implementations.

Cumulative Critic review (`rev-20260820T181429Z-411d7e43`): 0 blocking, 2 warning + 2 note, all
fixed and re-verified clean. Full suite: 6508 pass / 0 fail / 1 skipped.

One thing worth naming for the next reader of this repo's history: two of the fixes above exist
*because* re-checking a claim rather than trusting it surfaced something worse than reported — the
Codex "dead code" finding turned out to be a live capability lie, and a shipped commit's own
message ("Added Next Action preview") didn't match what the diff actually built (documented
honestly in `FEATURES.md` rather than propagated).

<!-- prawduct: type=bugfix | scope=master-level-takes-effect-968 | chunks=01,02 -->

The first real use of #755 found it: the toggle moved, the guard permitted the write, and the Master
refused anyway. It was refusing itself — the change path refreshed the guard and not the identity, so
the Master read `read-only` from month-old instructions and never attempted the write the guard was
waiting to allow.

Three things generalise:

- **"One call site is not the family" applies to ARTIFACTS, not just code sites.** #755 chunk 1 made
  the guard immediate and chunk 2 put the level into the identity; the change path refreshed one of
  the two, and every test in the suite read one of the artifacts that WAS being written. The fix was
  to delete the partial refresher rather than add a third write to it.
- **A detector that fires on the healthy path is worse than no detector.** The first shape of the
  staleness check compared the identity's mtime to the session start — and the identity was rewritten
  unconditionally on every ensure, which both surfaces fire on drawer open. It would have shown
  "restart to apply" permanently, which is the exact permanent nag the ruling behind it rejected.
  Caught by review, not by me. Write-if-changed; the mtime is load-bearing, so not touching it is
  part of the contract.
- **Verify a mechanism before offering it as an option.** The tmux session-start comparison was
  probed before it was put to the operator as a choice, and the probe found more than the bug: the
  live Master had been running a month against instructions rewritten the day before, so *nothing*
  regenerated in that month had reached it.

Also learned: `tmux display-message` does not fail on an absent session — it answers for the attached
client — so an exact-match target cannot protect it and the caller must check existence separately.
The codebase already documented this at one call site; the new one repeated the mistake. It cannot be
held behaviourally in a headless run (no attached client to fall back to), so a source-level guard
holds it, and the guard had to strip comments first because both callers explain the hazard in prose
directly above the check.

**Chunk 2 — Master Kill (also #768 chunk 3).** `POST /api/master/kill` plus the bar's Kill button,
which shipped dim from #768 waiting for this route. It is the remedy chunk 1 makes load-bearing: the
guard binds a level change at once, the running Master does not, so restarting it is what makes it
act. Killing an absent Master is SUCCESS — the operator's intent is "not running" and it already
holds — while a tmux that will not answer refuses, because a kill that could not be confirmed is not
a kill, and `hasSession` would have flattened that wedge into "already stopped" during exactly the
condition where the Master is most likely still running. `kill` leaving `tcMasterPendingReasons` is
the assertion that the pending treatment came off WITH the backend rather than beside it — the same
pattern `access` set in #755.

**Classification:** bugfix
