# Engine Guide

Engines in TangleClaw represent AI coding agents. TangleClaw abstracts engine differences so you can switch between Claude Code, Codex, Aider, or any custom engine without reconfiguring your projects.

## How Engines Work

Each engine is a JSON profile that tells TangleClaw:

- How to **detect** if the engine is installed
- How to **launch** the engine in a tmux session
- What **config file** format the engine expects (so TangleClaw can translate methodology rules)
- What **slash commands** the engine supports (shown as pills in the command bar)
- What **capabilities** the engine has (prime prompt support, co-author format, etc.)

Engine profiles live in `~/.tangleclaw/engines/`. TangleClaw ships with four built-in profiles, copied there on first run.

## Built-in Engines

### Claude Code

- **Command**: `claude`
- **Interaction model**: Session-based (spawns in tmux)
- **Config file**: `CLAUDE.md` (Markdown)
- **Slash commands**: `/compact` (compress context), `/clear` (clear conversation), `/review` (review changes)
- **Capabilities**: Slash commands, prime prompt, config file, co-author

### Codex

- **Command**: `codex`
- **Interaction model**: Session-based
- **Config file**: `.codex.yaml` (YAML)
- **Slash commands**: None
- **Capabilities**: Prime prompt, config file, co-author

### Aider

- **Command**: `aider`
- **Interaction model**: Session-based
- **Config file**: `.aider.conf.yml` (YAML)
- **Slash commands**: `/add` (add file to context), `/drop` (remove file), `/undo` (undo last change)
- **Capabilities**: Slash commands, prime prompt, config file, co-author

### Genesis

- **Command**: None (persistent agent)
- **Interaction model**: Persistent (connects to a running process, not managed by TangleClaw)
- **Config file**: None
- **Capabilities**: Placeholder — governance is handled by Mission Control, not TangleClaw

## Engine Detection

TangleClaw checks if each engine is available by running `which <command>`. The landing page shows an availability badge on each engine option:

- **Available** — the binary was found in PATH
- **Not found** — the binary is not in PATH

Detection happens when engines are listed via the API, not at startup.

## Creating a Custom Engine Profile

Create a JSON file at `~/.tangleclaw/engines/<engine-id>.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "my-engine",
  "name": "My Engine",
  "command": "my-engine-cli",
  "interactionModel": "session",
  "configFormat": {
    "filename": null,
    "syntax": null,
    "generator": null
  },
  "coAuthorFormat": "Co-Authored-By: {name} <{email}>",
  "commands": [
    {
      "label": "Help",
      "input": "/help",
      "description": "Show help"
    }
  ],
  "detection": {
    "strategy": "which",
    "target": "my-engine-cli"
  },
  "launch": {
    "shellCommand": "my-engine-cli",
    "args": ["--some-flag"],
    "env": {
      "MY_ENGINE_MODE": "interactive"
    }
  },
  "persistent": null,
  "capabilities": {
    "supportsSlashCommands": true,
    "supportsPrimePrompt": true,
    "supportsConfigFile": true,
    "supportsCoAuthor": true
  }
}
```

The `configFormat` above is set to `null` because config file generation requires a built-in generator. The available generators are `claude-md`, `codex-yaml`, and `aider-conf`. If your engine doesn't use a TangleClaw-generated config file, set all three fields to `null`. To add a new generator, you'd need to add a handler in `lib/engines.js`.

### Engine Profile Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | yes | Unique identifier |
| `name` | string | yes | Display name |
| `command` | string\|null | yes | CLI command to launch (null for persistent engines) |
| `interactionModel` | string | yes | `"session"` or `"persistent"` |
| `configFormat` | object | yes | Engine-specific config file details |
| `coAuthorFormat` | string\|null | yes | Git co-author pattern (null if unsupported) |
| `commands` | array | yes | Slash commands (shown as pills in command bar) |
| `detection` | object | yes | How to detect if installed |
| `launch` | object\|null | yes | Launch parameters (null for persistent engines) |
| `persistent` | object\|null | yes | Persistent engine config (null for session engines) |
| `capabilities` | object | yes | Feature flags |

### Config Format

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `filename` | Config file name written to project root (e.g., `CLAUDE.md`) |
| `syntax` | File syntax: `"markdown"`, `"yaml"`, or `null` |
| `generator` | Config generator to use: `"claude-md"`, `"aider-yaml"`, `"codex-yaml"`, or `null` |

### Detection Strategies

| Strategy | Target | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `"which"` | binary name | Run `which <target>` to check PATH |
| `"custom"` | null | No auto-detection (persistent engines) |

### Capabilities

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `supportsSlashCommands` | Engine has slash command input |
| `supportsPrimePrompt` | Engine accepts injected prime prompts |
| `supportsConfigFile` | Engine reads a config file from the project root |
| `supportsCoAuthor` | Engine supports git co-author attribution |

## Config File Generation

When a session launches, TangleClaw generates the engine-specific config file in the project root. This file is built from:

- The methodology template's rules and description
- The project's enabled extension rules
- The engine profile's config format

For example, a Claude Code project with Prawduct methodology gets a `CLAUDE.md` file containing the methodology rules in Markdown format. An Aider project gets the same rules translated to `.aider.conf.yml`.

This translation is automatic — methodology authors write rules once, and TangleClaw handles the format conversion.

## Switching Engines

You can change a project's engine at any time from the project settings on the landing page or the session settings modal. The change takes effect on the next session launch — TangleClaw regenerates the config file in the new engine's format.

No data is lost when switching engines. Session history, learnings, and methodology state are all engine-independent.
